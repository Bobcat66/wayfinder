MATRIX NAME GUIDELINES

To avoid unnecessary verbosity and improve readability, this code uses a standardized naming scheme for coordinate data.
A variable name will have three components: the library it comes from, this will be either OpenCV, denoted as "CV",
GTSAM, denoted as "GT", or Eigen, denoted as "EG". Wariables without an explicit library identifier are Eigen. The next portion is the
variable identifier. This is usually a single letter. Lowercase denotes a vector, while Uppercase denotes a matrix. Note that when a variable 
identifier has multiple letters, ONLY the FIRST letter matters in determining if the variable is a matrix or a vector. Some common
names include "t" for translation vectors, "r" for (rodrigues) rotation vectors, "q" for quaternions, "R" for rotation matrices, "T" for transformation matrices. None of the
identifier rules apply to GTSAM data, as GTSAM does not represent location data as matrices or vectors (at least not directly). GTSAM will have more verbose identifiers
The final component is the coordinate system, which is always a single letter (except for transformation matrices between coordinate systems. In those cases, the coordinate
system being transformed from goes first, and the coordinate system being transformed to goes second). WPILib coordinates are denoted with "w",
OpenCV coordinates are denoted with "c". When the coordinate system is indeterminate (e.g. in a parameter name), the variable name will have
a trailing underscore. Components of a name are separated with underscores. 
As an example, a rotation vector stored as an OpenCV Matrix in the WPILib coordinate system would be CV_r_w

This only applies to matrices and vectors that directly represent coordinates or rotations. Other matrices, such as camera
matrices, are not subject to these rules. Additionally, these rules do not apply in parts where types and coordinate systems are
unambiguous or don't matter
