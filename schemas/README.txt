NOTE: These schemas are NOT strictly enforced by Wayfinder at runtime. 
Instead, they serve as a consistent and unambiguous formal specification
of the JSON layout expected by Wayfinder. While Wayfinder will attempt
to detect some instances of misformatted JSON files, using a misformatted
JSON file may lead to undefined behavior.

NOTE: These schemas are now deprecated. Wayfinder now uses JVal, a custom internal solution for JSON validation.
The formal specifications for the JSON can be found in jval/schemas
