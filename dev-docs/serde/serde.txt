Wayfinder Serde

Wayfinder has a quick and dirty Serialization/Deserialization (serde) system for
internal use. It is designed for speed and not much else, and as such 
is only used for time-critical tasks, such as pipeline data. For less time-sensitive
applications, Protobufs is the preferred serde system. The specifics of
wayfinder's serde system are documented here.

Eventually I want to replace this system with WIPS, 
so these docs will be written in YAML so they can easily
be turned into machine-readable schema files

if a field is marked "VLA", that means it is a variable-length array, and there is a uint32
directly before it that marks how long it is

if a field is marked "optional", that means the value is optional, and there is a bool
directly before it that marks how long it is
