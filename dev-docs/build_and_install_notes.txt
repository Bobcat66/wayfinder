Wayfinder uses a two stage build system, the first stage is to build certain dependencies,
the second stage is to build wayfinder itself

All dependencies should be built with wayfinder in release builds, for maximum control

Other than the dependencies, the build process should emit two binaries: libwfcore.so,
a shared library containing most of wayfinder's functionality, and
wayfinderd, an executable which links to libwfcore.so that serves as the primary entry point for wayfinder.

During installation, a Systemd daemon will be configured on the host system that launches the 
wayfinderd executable on startup.

Also, test LTO for release builds
