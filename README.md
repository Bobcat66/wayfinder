# Wayfinder

Wayfinder is a robot pose estimation system for FRC combining vision-based pose estimation with a GTSAM-based SLAM solver. It contains three components: client, which is a web interface used for configuration, core, which is the main Wayfinder vision and SLAM system, and wayfinder-lib, which provides an easy to use abstraction over the Wayfinder Networktables API, and contains various robot-side utilities for Wayfinder.
