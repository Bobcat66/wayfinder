# SLAMVision

SLAMVision is a robot pose estimation system for FRC combining vision-based pose estimation with a GTSAM-based SLAM solver. It contains three components: svclient, which is a web interface used for configuration, svcore, which is the main SLAMVision system, and svlib, which provides an easy to use abstraction over the SLAMVision Networktables API, and contains various robot-side utilities for SLAMVision.
