# SLAMVision

SLAMVision is a robot pose estimation system for FRC combining vision-based pose estimation with a GTSAM-based PoseSLAM solver for sensor fusion. It contains three components: slamvision-client, which is a web interface used for configuration, slamvision-core, which is the main SLAMVision system, and slamvision-lib, which provides an easy to use abstraction over the SLAMVision Networktables API, and contains various robot-side utilities for SLAMVision
